# R exercises for the course: Data science for economists

## 1. Exercise on your own

Load the dataset __`Seatbelts`__ as part of the datasets package via `data(Seatbelts)`. Use `as.data.frame` to convert the object to a dataframe. Fit a linear model of driver deaths with `kms` and `PetrolPrice` as predictors. Interpret your results.

Predict the number of driver deaths at the average `kms` and `petrol` levels.

Take the residual for `DriversKilled` having regressed out `kms` and an intercept and the residual for `PetrolPrice` having regressed out `kms` and an intercept. Fit a regression through the origin of the two residuals and show that it is the same as your coefficient obtained in question 1.

Take the residual for `DriversKilled` having regressed out `PetrolPrice` and an intercept. Take the residual for `kms` having regressed out `PetrolPrice` and an intercept. Fit a regression through the origin of the two residuals and show that it is the same as your coefficient obtained in question 1.

Repeat question 1 for the outcome being the log of the count of driver deaths. Interpret your coefficients.

Refer to question 1. Add the dummy variable `law` and interpret the results. Repeat this question with a factor variable that you create called `lawFactor` that takes the levels `No` and `Yes`. Change the reference level from `No` to `Yes`

Here is a code to show a plot of Driver Fatalities by month. Change it accordingly and make it run:

```r
# Create a plot that shows seasonality of accidents as well as effect of law
driver.plot <- ggplot(seatbelts.data, aes(year, DriversKilled,
+ colour=law)) + geom_line() + xlab("Year") + ylab("Drivers
+ Killed") + facet_wrap(~month, ncol=6)
driver.plot <- driver.plot + opts(title="Drivers Fatalities in U.K.
+ by Month from 1969-1984")
```


## 2. For the next exercise you'll need the following libraries:

```r
library(NbClust)
library(readr)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

2.1. Use R-Studio to read `wine.csv`, a file containing some characteristics of some wines.


2.2 Standardize data and convert them to a dataframe.


2.3. Optimizing the number of clusters: use the `NbClust` library. [Here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NbClust/NbClust.pdf) you'll find some details and documentation of the library.

Use the function `NbClust` with _min num clusters = 2_, _max num cluster = 15_, Euclidean distance and `kmeans`. Repeat the exercise with the Manhattan distance. Report the differences.

2.4. Use with the dataframe on __2.2__ and find the number of clusters.

2.5. Calculate the mean of every variable for each cluster. _Tip: you can use something like the next line._

`aggregate(df[-1], by=list(cluster=fit$cluster), mean)`

If you were to choose 3 wine characteristics (variables) in order to differentiate them, which one would you use?

2.6. Use the `fviz_cluster` function to visualize the clusters. Report a plot with them.

2.7. Include labels of the `kmeans` on the original dataframe. _Tip: Use `cbind`_

2.8. Use a lineal regression with clusters as endogenous variables and all the others exogenous. What variables are statistically significant?
